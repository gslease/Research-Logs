## My Understanding of Technical Writing
My initial impression of technical writing was tha it was a type of writing designed to effectively communicate technical ideas to a variety audiences. According to the assigned readings, my initial impression was mostly accurate. The only notable difference was that I was not aware that the subject also included non-area-of-study-specific writing. By this, I mean that technical writing can be useed to explain a variety of instructions, whether they are related to a high tech discipline or not. Finding that out made it easier for me to think about some examples of technical writing I've seen in my life.
