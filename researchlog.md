# Research Log: Week 1

## Introduction
My name is Greg Slease, and I am a prospective pure mathematics major in my final quarter at Pierce College. My intnetion is to transfer to UW Seattle to finish my undergraduate degree, and then to go on to graduate schoold to obtain a Ph.D. in pure mathematics.

## My Understanding of Technical Writing
My initial impression of technical writing was tha it was a type of writing designed to effectively communicate technical ideas to a variety audiences. According to the assigned readings, my initial impression was mostly accurate. The only notable difference was that I was not aware that the subject also included non-area-of-study-specific writing. By this, I mean that technical writing can be useed to explain a variety of instructions, whether they are related to a high tech discipline or not. Finding that out made it easier for me to think about some examples of technical writing I've seen in my life.

## Setting Up My Github Account
Setting up my Github account was fairly straightforward, as was learning the basics of using branches. Thus far, I must say that I ama not a fan of the text editor, though. While I have no problem with text editing programs that do not offer immediate gratification (i.e. an immediate typeface alteration like what one might see with Word, Google Docs, etc.) I have so far yet to gain an understanding of what this particular text editor is better at than any others.

## The Prgramming Historian
From a brief inspection of the Programming Historian, I believe that the intended audeince of the site is people who are relatively new to programming, and/or simply not professional programmers. The purpose is to communicate concepts of programming that those who are more versed in the subject have deemed to be of some level of importance and/or interest with the general public.

## Pierce Hacker
The Pierce hacker site is clearly directed at students who wish to gain a better understanding of verious tech-tools at their disposal. The authors of the various articles likely wrote about the subjects that they did to share their knowledge about said resources that they had reason to believe were not nessecarily common knowledge throughout Pierce College.

## What I learned
This week, I have gained a general understanding of how this class is expected to go. I have also gained a better understanding as to what technical writing really is. For example, until this week, I did not know that simply writing step-by-step instructions fell into the realm of technical writing.
