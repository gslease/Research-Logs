# Research Log: Week 1

## Introduction
My name is Greg Slease, and I am a prospective pure mathematics major in my final quarter at Pierce College. My intention is to transfer to UW Seattle to finish my undergraduate degree, and then to go on to graduate school to obtain a Ph.D. in pure mathematics.

## My Understanding of Technical Writing
My initial impression of technical writing was that it was a type of writing designed to effectively communicate technical ideas to a variety audiences. According to the assigned readings, my initial impression was mostly accurate. The only notable difference was that I was not aware that the subject also included non-area-of-study-specific writing. By this, I mean that technical writing can be used to explain a variety of instructions, whether they are related to a high tech discipline or not. Finding that out made it easier for me to think about some examples of technical writing I've seen in my life.

## Setting Up My Github Account
Setting up my Github account was fairly straightforward, as was learning the basics of using branches. Thus far, I must say that I am not a fan of the text editor, though. While I have no problem with text editing programs that do not offer immediate gratification (i.e. an immediate typeface alteration like what one might see with Word, Google Docs, etc.) I have so far yet to gain an understanding of what this particular text editor is better at than any others.

## The Programming Historian
From a brief inspection of the Programming Historian, I believe that the intended audience of the site is people who are relatively new to programming, and/or simply not professional programmers. The purpose is to communicate concepts of programming that those who are more versed in the subject have deemed to be of some level of importance and/or interest with the general public.

## Pierce Hacker
The Pierce hacker site is clearly directed at students who wish to gain a better understanding of various tech-tools at their disposal. The authors of the various articles likely wrote about the subjects that they did to share their knowledge about said resources that they had reason to believe were not necessarily common knowledge throughout Pierce College.

## What I learned
This week, I have gained a general understanding of how this class is expected to go. I have also gained a better understanding as to what technical writing really is. For example, until this week, I did not know that simply writing step-by-step instructions fell into the realm of technical writing.

# Research Log Week 2

## Instruction Composition 
I think the composition of the instruction set went well overall. I chose to take slightly more text-heavy and image-light approach to the assignment compared to many others. I think that it worked relatively well for me, by there were certainly areas where I could improve to make the instructions a little for universal in terms of their usefulness and appeal to a wider audience.

## Audience 
In my perception, the audience for this piece would be people who are interested in construction, engineering, or just Lego in general. Due to this, I attempted to mimic some aspects of typical lego instructions (e.g. the box listing the required pieces at the beginning of each section), while also making it “my own” so to speak.

## Presentation Format 
For this assignment, I chose to use a pdf file for my instruction set. Overall, I think this was a good choice; the document came out clean, concise, and organized. The rough draft of my instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/gslease/lego_design/blob/master/IMG_20190419_085959637_HDR.jpg) , and the final draft is [here](https://app.luminpdf.com/viewer/fmvajHfdJS3bLgSz3/share?sk=b506b5f7-16de-4a0e-8e7a-1274c5bbc9cf). That being said however, my organization was somewhat lacking. For example, I received some criticism on my choice to place the images at the end of the instructions rather than the beginning.

## What I Learned 
I learned the importance of writing to my audience rather than myself. This will help me improve my ability to explain concepts and ideas going forward, which is one of my personal goals for the class.
